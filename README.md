Solar System

A simple Python console program that lets users explore basic information about the planets in our Solar System. This project demonstrates foundational Python concepts such as lists, functions, modular programming, user input handling, and basic graphics using the turtle module.

How to Run

To launch the program, simply execute:

python planet_main.py


Make sure all supporting files (e.g., planet_data.py, planet_features.py, planet_ui.py, planet_opencredit.py) are located in the same directory.

Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my learning process while studying Introduction to Python by Y. Daniel Liang. It includes:

Searching for planets

Listing planets with moons

Showing planets that may support life

Displaying basic Solar System visuals using turtle
